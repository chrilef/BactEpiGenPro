# BactEpiGenPro - Analyse and Visualise Methylation Patterns in Bacterial Genomes.

--- Under Development --- 

This software aims to provide a user friendly platform to determine methylation patterns and their effects on gene expression in bacterial genomes. Here you can download and run these tools on your own machine or from our website at http://begp.bi.up.ac.za. Additionally, we provide other potentially useful scripts for your methylation analysis.
